Dashboard Using Microsoft Power BI Project

Project Sequence:

1.) Loading the data into Power BI

2.) Data Cleaning

3.) DAX: Table, Measures, Calculated Column

4.) Data Validation

5.) Final Dashboard and Data Analysis

1. Loading the data into Power BI
📈 The data is imported through an Excel Workbook 📚 as the data source.
2. Data Cleaning
🔍 During data cleaning, various transformations are applied to the loaded data to ensure its quality and consistency. 
3. DAX: Data Analysis Expressions
📊 In this stage, DAX expressions are utilized to generate a new table based on existing data. Measures, such as sum, average, or count, are defined to calculate specific metrics. Calculated columns(🔢) are created to derive new values based on expressions involving existing columns.
4. Data Validation
💡🔍 Data validation is a crucial aspect of the data analyst’s role, ensuring accurate and reliable analysis, preventing costly mistakes, detecting anomalies, and empowering continuous improvement in decision-making.
5. Final Dashboard
